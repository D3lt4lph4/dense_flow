This repo is an updated version of the forked one based on [this issue](https://github.com/wanglimin/dense_flow/issues/35).

This is a sample code for extrating dense flow field given a video.

Usage:
./denseFlow_gpu -f test.avi -x tmp/flow_x -y tmp/flow_x -i tmp/image -b 20 -t 1 -d 0 -s 1
test.avi: input video
tmp: folder containing RGB images and optical flow images
